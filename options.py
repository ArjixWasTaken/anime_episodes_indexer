TMDB_METADATA_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 259200  # three days in seconds
"""
When you generate a json, it saves in the config the last modified time.
You set an interval for how much is the minimal wait time until it tries to fetch new metadata from tmdb.
Don't set this value lower than a day, fetching new metadata longers the runtime, and if you manage a huge library time is precious.
"""
jsonPath = './database.json'
"""
This here is the filename that will be used to save the json.
If a folder doesn't exist there is no try/except block, so make sure the filepath you enter here is valid.
Else the code will error.
"""
